To run the TNB Electricity Calculator project, you can follow these steps:

1. Install XAMPP on your machine by downloading it from the official website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and following the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Once XAMPP is installed, start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.

3. Create a new directory inside the htdocs folder of your XAMPP installation directory (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs) and name it as per your preference (e.g., tnb-calculator).

4. Inside the tnb-calculator directory, create a new file called index.php.

5. Copy the PHP code provided earlier into the index.php file.

6. Save the file.

7. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/tnb-calculator (replace tnb-calculator with the name you chose for your directory).

8. You should see the TNB Electricity Calculator web page.

9. Fill in the voltage, current, and rate values in the respective input fields.

10. Click the "Calculate" button.

11. The results, including the power, rate, hourly consumption, and daily consumption, should be displayed on the page.

12. By following these steps, you will be able to run the TNB Electricity Calculator project using XAMPP. Make sure XAMPP's Apache and MySQL services are running to execute the PHP code.
